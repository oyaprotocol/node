# Oya Node

`node` is a TypeScript/bun-based full node for the Oya natural language protocol. It allows nodes to both propose new bundles (containing signed, natural language intentions) and in the near future will be able to verify and dispute bundles from other proposers. In addition, the API exposes endpoints for querying the protocol's current stateâ€”including bundles, CIDs, balances, and vault nonces.

**WARNING: This software is early-stage and experimental and under active development. It should not be used in production. The underlying Oya Protocol has not been deployed to mainnet, and is itself experimental. The current node implementation supports bundle proposals and processing for a single bundle proposer only. Functionality to view and verify bundles from other proposers is not yet implemented. Users and developers should expect many breaking changes as the codebase evolves. Contributions and feedback are very welcome!**

## Features

- **Natural Language protocol Node:** Accepts signed intentions in natural language.
- **Proposer:** Caches incoming intentions and periodically bundles them into a bundle.
- **Protocol Contract Integration:** Interacts with the [BundleTracker](https://github.com/oyaprotocol/contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#bundletracker) smart contract via ethers.js.
- **IPFS Storage:** Uses Helia to upload bundle data to IPFS.
- **Robust API Endpoints:** Exposes endpoints for bundles, CIDs, balances, and nonces.
- **PostgreSQL Backend:** Uses PostgreSQL for persisting protocol state, including bundles, balances, and nonces.
- **Automated Balance & Reward Updates:** Processes transfers or swaps and mints rewards automatically.

## Architecture Overview

- **Express Server:** The main entry point (`index.ts`) sets up the Express server, JSON parsing, and routes.
- **Routing & Controllers:** API endpoints are defined in `routes.ts` and implemented in `controllers.ts`. These endpoints manage database operations for bundles, CIDs, balances, and vault nonces.
 - **Vaults:** The `vaults` table maps vault IDs to controller addresses and vault rules; corresponding endpoints are mounted under `/vault`.
- **Proposer Logic:** Implemented in `proposer.ts`, this module:
  - Processes incoming intentions from the `/intention` endpoint.
  - Caches intentions and bundles them into a bundle every 10 seconds.
  - Signs the bundle, uploads it to IPFS via Helia, interacts with the BundleTracker contract, and updates the database accordingly.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage. Migration scripts (e.g., `migrations/1_createTable.sh`) set up the required tables.

## Prerequisites

- **Bun:** Version 1.0 or later ([install from bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- **curl and tar:** Maybe required for downloading native modules
- **npm (optional):** If available, provides faster native module downloads via prebuild-install
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Either local or hosted (e.g., via Heroku)
- **Alchemy API Key:** For interacting with Ethereum networks
- **BundleTracker Contract:** A deployed BundleTracker contract (its address must be provided)
- **IPFS (Helia):** Used internally to store bundle data
- **Docker:** (Optional) For containerized deployment

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oyaprotocol/node.git
   cd node
   ```

2. **Run setup (installs dependencies and links the `oya` command):**

   ```bash
   bun setup
   ```

   This will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Download prebuilt native modules (uses npx if available, otherwise curl + tar)
   - Link the `oya` command globally

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (or use your preferred configuration method) in the project root with the following variables:

```ini
# Bearer token for securing write endpoints
API_BEARER_TOKEN=your_secure_token_here
# PostgreSQL database connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database

# Alchemy API Key for Ethereum network access
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key

# Deployed BundleTracker contract address
BUNDLE_TRACKER_ADDRESS=your_bundle_tracker_contract_address
(This will be 0xd4af8d53a8fccacd1dc8abe8ddf7dfbc4b81546c on Sepolia.)

# Public/Private key used by the bundle proposer for signing bundles (ensure this is kept secure)
PROPOSER_ADDRESS=your_public_key
PROPOSER_KEY=your_private_key

# Optional: Filecoin Pin integration (for archival storage on Filecoin)
FILECOIN_PIN_ENABLED=false  # Set to true to enable Filecoin pinning
FILECOIN_PIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your_filecoin_private_key
FILECOIN_PIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1  # Calibration testnet
```

See `.env.example` for a complete list of available configuration options including optional variables like `PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DATABASE_SSL`, and `DIAGNOSTIC_LOGGER`.

## Testnet Contracts
Instances of the BundleTracker and VaultTracker contracts are deployed on Sepolia Testnet at the following addresses: 

- BundleTracker: [0x4b05e1269b74d031B80E8c6973cA076b681914E7](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4b05e1269b74d031B80E8c6973cA076b681914E7#code)
- VaultTracker: [0x6f2B59f69296c9F045C699472174D878BB4B8aB8](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6f2B59f69296c9F045C699472174D878BB4B8aB8#code)


## Database Setup

The database can be created and set up using the `oya` CLI or `bun` commands:

```bash
# Create the oya_db database (if it doesn't exist)
oya db:create

# Set up database tables (safe to run multiple times)
oya db:setup

# Drop and recreate all tables (WARNING: deletes all data!)
oya db:reset

# Or use bun directly
bun run db:create
bun run db:setup
bun run db:reset

# Or run directly with custom DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/oya_db bun run scripts/setup-db.js
```

The setup script creates the following tables:

- **bundles:** Stores bundle data and nonce.
- **cids:** Stores IPFS CIDs corresponding to bundles.
- **balances:** Tracks token balances per vault.
- **nonces:** Tracks the latest nonce for each vault.
 - **proposers:** Tracks last-seen timestamps for block proposers.
 - **vaults:** Maps vault IDs (`vault` TEXT PK) to `controllers` (TEXT[]) and optional `rules` (TEXT). Includes a GIN index on `controllers` for fast lookups.

If deploying to Heroku, run the migration script as follows:

```bash
chmod +x migrations/1_createTable.sh
./migrations/1_createTable.sh --app-name your-heroku-app-name
```

Alternatively, execute the SQL commands manually in your PostgreSQL instance.

## Filecoin Pin Setup (Optional)

The Oya node supports optional archival storage on Filecoin using the [filecoin-pin SDK](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin-pin). When enabled, bundle data is automatically uploaded to both IPFS and Filecoin for redundancy and long-term permanence.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling Filecoin pinning, you need:

1. **Testnet FIL**: For paying transaction gas fees on Filecoin Calibration testnet
   - Get testnet FIL from: https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/

2. **USDFC Tokens**: Test USDFC tokens for paying Filecoin storage costs
   - Get testnet USDFC from: https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc
   - Or trade tFIL for USDFC at: https://app.usdfc.net/#/

3. **Wallet Setup**: A dedicated Filecoin wallet with a private key
   - Add `FILECOIN_PIN_PRIVATE_KEY` to your `.env` file
   - Add `FILECOIN_PIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1` for Calibration testnet

### Automated Setup

The easiest way to configure Filecoin pinning is using the automated setup script:

```bash
# Ensure FILECOIN_PIN_PRIVATE_KEY and FILECOIN_PIN_RPC_URL are set in .env
oya filecoin:setup

# Or use bun directly
bun run filecoin:setup
```

This script will:
- Check your FIL balance (needed for gas)
- Check your USDFC balance (needed for storage payments)
- Approve the WARM_STORAGE contract to spend USDFC
- Approve the PAYMENTS contract to spend USDFC
- Deposit 1 USDFC into the Filecoin Pay system
- Display estimated storage allowance

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup, you can use the filecoin-pin CLI directly:

```bash
npx filecoin-pin payments setup --auto \
  --private-key "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  --rpc-url "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1"
```

This command will:
1. Configure all necessary token approvals for both WARM_STORAGE and PAYMENTS contracts
2. Deposit 1 USDFC into the Filecoin Pay system for storage payments
3. Display your storage allowance (approximately 558.5 GiB for 1 month with 1 USDFC)

For more control over the deposit amount:

```bash
# Deposit a specific amount (e.g., 10 USDFC)
npx filecoin-pin payments deposit \
  --amount 10 \
  --private-key "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  --rpc-url "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1"
```

### Enabling Filecoin Pinning

Once setup is complete, enable Filecoin pinning in your `.env`:

```ini
FILECOIN_PIN_ENABLED=true
```

Restart the node, and bundle uploads will automatically be pinned to both IPFS and Filecoin.

### Troubleshooting

**"insufficient funds to cover lockup" error:**
- This means you need to run the payments setup command above
- Ensure you have both FIL (for gas) and USDFC (for storage) in your wallet
- The payments setup configures TWO contract approvals (WARM_STORAGE and PAYMENTS)

**Check your setup:**

```bash
# Check balances and approvals
node approve-filecoin.js

# Check current Filecoin Pay deposit
npx filecoin-pin payments balance \
  --private-key "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" \
  --rpc-url "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1"
```

### Monitoring Filecoin Uploads

When Filecoin pinning is enabled, you'll see logs like:

```
[FilecoinPin] Starting Filecoin pin for bundle nonce X, CID: bafkrei...
[FilecoinPin] Created new data set { dataSetId: 743 }
[FilecoinPin] Upload complete for bafkrei... Piece CID: bafkzcibd...
[FilecoinPin] Transaction submitted: 0x2cd49a...
[FilecoinPin] Filecoin storage confirmed for bafkrei...
```

You can also query bundle status via the API:

```bash
GET /bundle/:nonce
# Returns bundle with filecoin_status, filecoin_piece_cid, filecoin_tx_hash
```

## Running the Application

### Using Bun or Oya CLI

After setting up your environment and database, you can start the server locally with:

```bash
# Using the oya command
oya start

# Or with debug logging
oya start:debug

# Or using bun directly
bun start
```

The server listens on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `3000`).

### Using Docker Locally

The Dockerfile uses Bun for a streamlined, single-stage build with optimized native module handling:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package.json bun.lockb* ./

# Download prebuilt native module for Alpine (avoids needing npm/build tools)
RUN bun install --production && \
    wget -q https://github.com/ipshipyard/js-node-datachannel/releases/download/v0.26.6/node-datachannel-v0.26.6-napi-v8-linuxmusl-x64.tar.gz && \
    tar -xzf node-datachannel-v0.26.6-napi-v8-linuxmusl-x64.tar.gz -C node_modules/@ipshipyard/node-datachannel && \
    rm node-datachannel-v0.26.6-napi-v8-linuxmusl-x64.tar.gz

# Copy source code and CLI binary
COPY src ./src
COPY bin ./bin

# Link CLI globally
RUN bun link

# Expose port and set environment
EXPOSE 3000
ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["bun", "run", "src/index.ts"]
```

To build and run the container locally:

1. **Build the image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t oya-node .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env oya-node
   ```

Your application will now be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

Below is a summary of the main API endpoints:

- **Bundles**
  - `GET /bundle` â€” Retrieve all bundles.
  - `GET /bundle/:nonce` â€” Retrieve a bundle by its nonce.
  - `POST /bundle` â€” Save a bundle (typically called internally after publishing).

- **CIDs**
  - `POST /cid` â€” Save a CID (internal use).
  - `GET /cid/:nonce` â€” Retrieve CIDs for a given nonce.

- **Balances**
  - `GET /balance/:vault` â€” Get balances for all tokens for a given vault.
  - `GET /balance/:vault/:token` â€” Get the balance for a specific token for a vault.
  - `POST /balance` â€” Update the balance for a token (insert if not already present).

- **Vault Nonces**
  - `GET /nonce/:vault` â€” Get the nonce for a given vault.
  - `POST /nonce/:vault` â€” Set/update the nonce for a vault.

- **Vaults**
  - `GET /vault/by-controller/:address` â€” Get array of vault IDs controlled by an Ethereum `address`.
  - `GET /vault/:vaultId/controllers` â€” Get the array of controller addresses for a `vaultId`.
  - `GET /vault/:vaultId/rules` â€” Get the rules for a `vaultId` as `{ "vault": string, "rules": string | null }`.
  - `POST /vault/:vaultId/controllers/add` â€” Add a `controller` to `vaultId` (idempotent). Returns `{ "vault": string, "controllers": string[] }`. ðŸ”’
  - `POST /vault/:vaultId/controllers/remove` â€” Remove a `controller` from `vaultId`. Returns `{ "vault": string, "controllers": string[] }`. 404 if vault not found. ðŸ”’
  - `POST /vault/:vaultId/rules` â€” Set or clear `rules` (string or null) for `vaultId`. Returns `{ "vault": string, "rules": string | null }`. ðŸ”’

  Notes:
  - All POST endpoints are protected by Bearer auth (see `API_BEARER_TOKEN`).
  - Controller addresses are validated and normalized to lowercase.
  
- **Intentions**
  - `POST /intention` â€” Accepts a JSON payload with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "intention": { /* intention object */ },
      "signature": "signature_string", // Intention signed by the Controller wallet
      "controller": "eth_address" // address controlling a given Vault
    }
    ```

    This endpoint passes the intention to the bundle proposer logic after verifying the signature.

## Bundle Proposing Workflow

1. **Receiving Intentions:**
   When a client posts to `/intention`, the application verifies the signature (using ethersâ€™ `verifyMessage`) and caches the intention.

2. **Creating a Bundle:**
   Every 10 seconds, the application checks if there are cached intentions. If so, it:
   - Retrieves the latest nonce from the database.
   - Bundles all cached intentions into a bundle.
   - Signs the bundle using the bundle proposerâ€™s private key.
   - Uploads the bundle data to IPFS via Helia.
   - Calls the `proposeBundle` function on the BundleTracker contract using ethers.js.
   - Persists the bundle and associated CID to the database.
   - Updates balances based on the transactions in the bundle.
   - Mints rewards to the relevant addresses.

3. **Error Handling:**
   The bundle proposer logic includes error handling for signature verification, IPFS uploads, protocol transactions, and database operations.

## Testing

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
bun test
```

Tests are written using Bun's built-in test runner and are located in the `test` directory.

## Deployment

The application is fully containerized using Docker, which allows you to deploy it anywhere that supports Docker (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, or on your local server). Below are instructions for deploying the application on Heroku using Docker as an example.

### Deploying on Heroku (Example)

1. **Log in to the Heroku Container Registry:**

   ```bash
   heroku container:login
   ```

2. **Build and Push the Docker Image:**

   Build your Bun-based image for the `linux/amd64` architecture and push directly to Heroku's registry:

   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --provenance=false --push -t registry.heroku.com/your-heroku-app/web:latest .
   ```

   Alternatively, you can disable provenance by setting an environment variable before building:

   ```bash
   export BUILDX_NO_DEFAULT_ATTESTATIONS=1
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t registry.heroku.com/your-heroku-app/web:latest .
   ```

3. **Release the Container on Heroku:**

   ```bash
   heroku container:release web --app your-heroku-app
   ```

4. **Verify the Deployment:**

   Check running dynos:

   ```bash
   heroku ps --app your-heroku-app
   ```

   View logs:

   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail --app your-heroku-app
   ```

### Other Deployment Options

Since the application is containerized, you can also deploy it to any hosting provider that supports Docker. For example:

* **Local Deployment with Docker Compose:** Create a docker-compose.yml file to bring up your application along with its dependencies (such as PostgreSQL).

* **Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc.):** Use orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) or managed container services (such as AWS Fargate or Google Cloud Run) to deploy your Docker image.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future releases include (but are not limited to):

- **Multi-Proposer Support:**
  Extend the system to fetch, display, and verify bundles from multiple proposers by parsing onchain event logs. This will allow nodes to cross-check and validate proposals from different sources.

- **Enhanced Bundle Verification:**
  Develop robust mechanisms for verifying the correctness of bundles proposed by various nodes, improving overall network security and consensus.

- **Expanded API Functionality:**
  Add new API endpoints to query detailed bundle and proposer information.

- **Robust Error Handling and Logging:**
  Improve error handling in the bundle proposer logic and enhance logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  Optimize the node for scalability and higher throughput as the network and transaction volumes grow.
